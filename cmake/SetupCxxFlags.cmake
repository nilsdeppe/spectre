# We are getting multiple types of linker warnings on macOS:
# - "ranlib: archive library: tmp/libSpectrePchLib.a the table of contents is
#   empty (no object file members in the library define global symbols)":
#   Yes, some of our libs have no symbols. Doesn't seem like a problem.
# - "-undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups":
#   This warning appears when compiling Python bindings. Chained fixups were
#   introduced in AppleClang 13 and enabled by default in macOS 12. See these
#   upstream issues:
#   - CPython: https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97524
#   - Pybind11: https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/pull/4301
#   - CMake: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/24044
#   Disabling chained fixups with `-Wl-no_fixup_chains` leads to linker warnings
#   about inconsistent visibility settings in different translation units. We
#   probably have to wait for an upstream solution to this issue.
# - "could not create compact unwind for SYMBOL: registers X and
#   Y not saved contiguously in frame":
#   We have seen these warnings on Apple Silicon chips.
#   Disabling compact unwind with the flags
#     -Wl,-keep_dwarf_unwind
#     -Wl,-no_compact_unwind
#   seems to work on some machines, but leads to segfaults on others. We haven't
#   investigated this in any more detail.
# For now we just suppress these linker warnings altogether, since we haven't
# encountered any problems with them and some are upstream issues.
