/*!
 * \brief Slice the subcell variables needed for neighbors to perform
 * reconstruction.
 *
 * Note that we slice to a grid that is against the boundary of the element but
 * is several ghost points deep. This is in contrast to the slicing used in the
 * DG method which is to the boundary of the element only.
 *
 * The `number_of_ghost_points` will depend on the number of neighboring points
 * the reconstruction method needs that is used on the subcell. The
 * `directions_to_slice` determines in which directions data is sliced.
 * Generally this will be the directions in which the element has neighbors.
 *
 * The data always has the same ordering as the volume data (tags have the same
 * ordering, grid points are x-varies-fastest).
 *
 * The `additional_buffer` argument is used to add extra padding to the result
 * storage to be used for example for sending the RDMP TCI data. This eliminates
 * expensive data copying.
