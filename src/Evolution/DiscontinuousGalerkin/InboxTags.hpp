/*!
 * \brief The inbox tag for boundary correction communication and DG-subcell
 * ghost zone cells.
 *
 * The stored data consists of the following (in argument order of the tuple):
 *
 * 1. the mesh of the ghost cell data we received. This allows eliding
 *    projection when all neighboring elements are doing DG.
 * 2. the mesh of the neighboring element's face (not the mortar mesh!)
 * 3. the variables at the ghost zone cells for finite difference/volume
 *    reconstruction
 * 4. the data on the mortar needed for computing the boundary corrections (e.g.
 *    fluxes, characteristic speeds, conserved variables)
 * 5. the TimeStepId beyond which the boundary terms are no longer valid, when
 *    using local time stepping.
 *
 * The TimeStepId is the neighboring element's next time step. When using local
 * time stepping, the neighbor's boundary data is valid up until this time,
 * which may include multiple local time steps. By receiving and storing the
 * neighbor time step, the local element knows whether or not it should remove
 * boundary data and expect new data to be sent from the neighbor.
 *
 * The ghost cell data (second element of the tuple) will be valid whenever a
 * DG-subcell scheme is being used. Whenever a DG-subcell scheme is being used,
 * elements using DG and not FD/FV always send both the ghost cells and boundary
 * correction data together. Elements using FD/FV send the ghost cells first
 * followed by the boundary correction data once the element has received all
 * neighbor ghost cell data. Note that the second send/receive only modifies the
 * flux and the TimeStepId used for the flux validity range.
 *
 * When only a DG scheme (not a DG-subcell scheme) is used the ghost cell data
 * will never be valid.
 *
 * In the DG-subcell scheme this tag is used both for communicating the ghost
 * cell data needed for the FD/FV reconstruction step and the data needed for
 * the boundary corrections.
 * - For an element using DG, both ghost cells and boundary corrections are
 *   sent using a single communication. After receiving all neighbor
 *   boundary corrections the element can finish computing the time step.
 *   The ghost cell data from neighbors is unused.
 * - For an element using FD/FV, first the ghost cells are sent. Once all
 *   neighboring ghost cell data is received, reconstruction is done and the
 *   boundary terms are computed and sent to the neighbors. After receiving all
 *   neighbor boundary corrections the element can finish computing the time
 *   step.
 * - Whether or not an extra communication is needed when an element switches
 *   from DG to FD/FV depends on how exactly the decision to switch is
 *   implemented. If the volume terms are integrated and verified to be
 *   valid before a DG element sends ghost cell and boundary data then no
 *   additional communication is needed when switching from DG to FD/FV. In this
 *   case a second check of the data that includes the boundary correction needs
 *   to be done. If the second check determines a switch from DG to FD/FV is
 *   needed, we can continue to use the DG fluxes since the evolution in the
 *   small was valid, thus avoiding an additional communication. However, to
 *   fully guarantee physical realizability a second communication or evolving
 *   the neighboring ghost cells needs to be done. We have not yet decided how
 *   to deal with the possible need for an additional communication since it
 *   also depends on whether or not we decide to couple to Voronoi instead of
 *   just Neumann neighbors.
 * - The data for the inbox tags is erased after the boundary correction is
 *   complete and the solution has been verified to be valid at the new time
 *   step. The ghost cells could be invalidated immediately after
 *   reconstruction, thus using the ghost cell data after reconstruction is
 *   complete is considered undefined behavior. That is, we make no guarantee as
 *   to whether or not it will work.
 * - The reason for minimizing the number of communications rather than having a
 *   more uniform implementation between DG and FD/FV is that it is the number
 *   of communications that adds the most overhead, not the size of each
 *   communication. Thus, one large communication is cheaper than several small
 *   communications.
