# Profiling {#profiling}

There are a number of tools available for profiling, each with their own
strengths and weaknesses. This makes it difficult to recommend one "right" way
of analyzing performance using profilers. Instead, one should use a combination
of the tools to discover and eliminate performance bottle necks. Common
profilers are Charm++ Projections (tracing-based), HPCToolkit (sampling-based,
vary versatile), Linux perf (sampling-based, command line only), Intel VTune
(sampling-based, works well on Intel hardware), and AMD uProf (similar to Intel
VTune).

## Profiling with HPCToolkit {#profiling_with_hpctoolkit}

Follow the HPCToolkit installation instructions at
[hpctoolkit.org](http://hpctoolkit.org). The Spack
installation seems to work well. Once installed, compile your executable in
Release mode with `-D ENABLE_PROFILING=ON -D DEBUG_SYMBOLS=ON` since otherwise
you won't be able to get call stacks and source analysis. Using `-D
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` is recommended since it makes HPCToolkit a lot easier to
use. You must also use the system allocator, `-D MEMORY_ALLOCATOR=SYSTEM`. Once
you've built your executable (we will call it `EXEC`). We will work from the
build directory and perform all runs and performance analysis there.

First you must run
```
hpcstruct ./bin/EXEC
```
This will generate an `EXEC.hpcstruct` file in your build directory. You can now
run HPCToolkit as:
```
hpcrun -t --event CYCLES@f200 ./bin/EXEC --input-file ./Input.yaml +p1
```
We will profile on one care, but you can profile on multiple cores as well as
multiple nodes if using MPI as the Charm++ backend.

Once the run is complete, run
```
hpcprof -I /path/to/spectre/src/+ hpctoolkit-EXEC-measurements
```
This will create the directory
```
hpctoolkit-EXEC-database
```
which you can view using
```
hpcviewer ./hpctoolkit-EXEC-database
```

HPCViewer will generally start you in the `Top-down view` (callgraph of
callers). You can select  `Bottom-up view` (callgraph of callees) to get a
different perspective. Whether you want to look at the callgraph of callers or
callees depends a bit on the executable, what you're looking to measure, and how
you like to think about things. The callees graph can give you a nice overview
of what the low-level things taking up a lot of time are, but certainly makes
the call stack not look like you would expect. On the right of the callgraphs
you will see `CYCLES:Sum (I)` and `CYCLES:Sum (E)`. `I` means time spent
_including_ callees, while `E` means time spent in the function itself
(exclusive time). Sorting by exclusive gives a good idea of what the hot
functions are. Here is a screenshot from HPCViewer:

\image html HpcViewerCallees.png "HPCViewer callgraph of callees"

You can see that 49.1% of inclusive time is spent in primitive recovery, and the
next line is a function inside the Kastaun recovery scheme. The
`__nss_database_lookup` is some system call, e.g. `__memcpy_avx_unaligned_erms`
or `__memset_avx2_unaligned_erms`. Looking at the calling code,
e.g. `prepare_neighbor_data` gives a good hint as to what's going on. In most
cases these are memory copies or memory sets (`std::vector` default initializes
its memory, which is bad for performance). The way to fix these bottlenecks is
to avoid memory copies and `std::vector<double>` as buffers.

HPCToolkit allows you to sample on a variety of different event counters instead
of just cycles. Please see the HPCToolkit manual for details.

## Profiling with AMD uProf {#profiling_with_amd_uprof}

AMD uProf is AMD's sampling-based profiler that makes it relatively easy to do
quite a bit of detailed performance analysis. The uProf manual is quite good and
extensive, so for the most part the reader is referred to that. However, we will
go over some basics for profiling executables and understanding the
results. Make sure to compile your executable in Release mode with
`-DENABLE_PROFILING=ON -D DEBUG_SYMBOLS=ON` since otherwise you won't be able to
get call stacks and source analysis.

When you open uProf you may be asked to change the kernel event paranoid
level. Once you have uProf open, select `PROFILE` at the top. Specify the
application path, options, etc. We will again run on a single core to analyze
performance. It's recommended that you set the Core Affinity so that your
application isn't migrated between cores during a profiling run. Then choose
`Next` in the lower right corner. Make sure the `CPU Profile Type` is set to
`CPU Profile` at the top. We will first do a `Time-based Sampling` run (on the
left). This means uProf will interrupt the application every `N` milliseconds
and see where the application is. You typically want a few thousand total
samples to get something that's reasonably representative of your
application. Under the `Advanced Options` make sure `Enable CSS` (on the right)
is enabled (green) and that `Enable FPO` is also enabled. Now click `Start
Profile` in the bottom right. Once the profile is complete you will be presented
with a summary outlining where your code is spending most of its time. Click
`ANALYZE` at the top to get a more detailed view. On the left you can select
between a callgraph of callees (Function HotSpots), a callgraph of callers (Call
Graph), and a few other views. Below is an example of a result from the same run
we used with HPCToolkit above.

Again we see that most of our time is spent in primitive recovery but also that
a lot of time is spent copying memory. This was grouped into
`__nss_database_lookup` in HPCToolkit. Unfortunately, getting a call stack out
of the `memcpy` doesn't always work and so while you know you're spending a lot
of time copying memory, it's not so obvious where those copies are occurring.

## Profiling With Charm++ Projections {#profiling_with_projections}

To view trace data after a profiling run you must download Charm++'s
Projections software from their [website](http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/).
If you encounter issues it may
be necessary to clone the git repository and build the correct version
from scratch. Note that the version of Charm++ used to compile SpECTRE
should match the version of Projections used to analyze the trace data.
You can collect the trace data on a different machine than the one you
will be analyzing the data on. For example, you can collect the data on
a supercomputer and analyze it on your desktop or laptop.

For profiling you will want to use a production build of Charm++, which
means compiling Charm++ with the `--with-production` flag. To enable trace
collecting you must build with the `--enable-tracing` flag as well. For
example, on a multicore 64-bit Linux machine the build command would be
``` shell
./build LIBS multicore-linux-x86_64 gcc -j8 --with-production --enable-tracing
```
You must build your executable in Release mode as well, specifying
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` to CMake, as well as
```
-DCHARM_TRACE_PROJECTIONS=ON -DCHARM_TRACE_SUMMARY=ON -DENABLE_PROFILING=ON
```
to enable SpECTRE to use Charm++'s tracing features.

### Running SpECTRE With Trace Output

When running SpECTRE you must specify a directory to output trace data into.
This is done by adding the command line argument `+traceroot DIR` where `DIR` is
the directory to dump the trace data into. Note that `DIR` must already exist,
the application will not create it.
For example,

```shell
./bin/EXEC --input-file ./Input.yaml +p4 +traceroot ./ExecTraces
```
You might get a warning that Charm++ had to flush the log some number of times
during the run. Flushing the log adds overhead to the execution and so affects
timing measurements. While Charm++ has the ability to manually flush the log
periodically (and therefore exclude the time it takes to flush the log from the
trace), we have not yet implemented support for this. For short executable runs
you can increase the log size by specifying `+logsize M` when running the
executable. The default log size is 1,000,000 (1000000). Note that if you
increase the log size too much you will run out of memory/RAM.

For more information on runtime options to
control trace data see the
[Charm++ Projections manual](http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/projections/1.html).

### Visualizing Trace %Data In Projections

By default Charm++ records entry method names by using the `PRETTY_FUNCTION`
macro. This means entry method names include all class (parallel component) and
action template parameter names, including any template parameters of the
template parameters. This very quickly leads to incomprehensibly long names that
are very difficult to read in the Projections interface. We include a basic
Python executable to handle the majority of renames, but the executable supports
additional basic (textual find-replace) and regular expression
replacements via a JSON file. These additional replacements are useful for
making executable-specific renames. The Python executable is
`tools/CharmSimplifyTraces.py` and an example replacements file is
`tools/CharmTraceReplacements.json`.

See the [Charm++ Projections manual](http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/projections/2.html)
for details.
